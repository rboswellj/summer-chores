Practice for callbacks in JS

When ran the function doSummerChores is called.
This initiates the callback sequence that performs the chores.
Checks are done before each chore to check if the person is too exhausted to continue.

As the user completes chores the likelihood that they will be too tired to continue and will fall asleep increases.

At the end there is an announcement when all chores are completed.
